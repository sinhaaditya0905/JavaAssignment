This Project is Java Based project and I have used SpringBoot here


I have created this project on IntellijIDEA and used MySQL as a database 

IDE >> IntellijIDEA.
Database >> MySQL
Frontend >> html

Tools >> lombok, DataJPA, MySQL Driver, Spring security

First I have created the entity of Customer and then stared working on controller service and repository layer.
hibernate = auto update so daatabase is done dynamically
then static html files.
and after that authentication and authorization with spring security.
